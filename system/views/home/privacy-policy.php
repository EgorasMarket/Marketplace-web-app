                Egoras strives to give the best offers to sell your old gadget; then Egoras refers you to a buyer for your product. We will share your personal information with these carefully selected buyers only when you agree to submit for a quote. Registration on Egoras is voluntary; if you do decide to register, we will not share your personal information until you agree to submit to a quote.

                </p>
                <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
                <p>
                We collect standard information about Egoras users such as IP addresses, browser type, operating system, device type, what you searched for, referring and exit pages, the dates and times of visits, and other site usage behavior (“Site Visitation Data”).Site Visitation Data is used to administer the site and provide general statistics regarding the use of Egoras. We may also use Site Visitation Data to share important updates and information through email & SMS, and also prevent communication that you might not interest you. While selling or registering with our Site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, mailing address or phone number. You may, however, visit our site anonymously. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Site to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly, while doing so we collect personal information from you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                Like most websites, we use cookies and/or web beacons to enhance your experience, gather general visitor information, and track visits to our website. Please refer to the section below entitled “Use of cookies and tracking technology” for information about cookies and how we use them.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                To help improve our site and services, we may collect certain technical information from your browser software, screen resolution and the website that referred you to us.
                </p>
                <h4>Sharing information with friends and in user forums</h4>
                <p>
                The Egoras allows you to share certain information with friends that you select. Please bear in mind that Egoras cannot control what your friends do with the information you share with them, so you should only share with friends you trust. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, information that you share can be collected and used by others. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, please contact us at info@Egoras.in. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
                </p>
                <p>
                Furthermore, if you participate in a user forum on the Egoras website, your comments and your Egoras username will be displayed to all Egoras users on the forum. Egoras is not responsible for what any user or third party may do with information that you choose to share.
                </p>
                <p>
                We may also provide a feature allowing you to invite a friend to join Egoras. If you provide a friend’s email address to us for this reason, we will use that email address only for the purpose of sending a onetime invitation to your friend. Your friend may contact us at info@Egoras.in to remove their information from our database.
                </p>
                <h4>Use of personal information</h4>
                <p>
                We will treat your personal information as confidential, and we will not share your personal information with third parties without your permission, except in the limited circumstances described below. If you accept a referral from Egoras to one of our partner sites, we may provide PII to the partner site to save you having to re-enter that information. When you select a partner site to sell your article(s) to, you must opt in to allow your PII to be submitted to that partner site, and you agree to be bound by their privacy policy as regards use of your PII.
                </p>
                <p>
                We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as fulfilling your request for a free shipping kit, purchasing your article(s), or sending confirmation or other emails. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                We may provide your personal information to our third party marketing partners so they may offer you goods and services which you may find of interest. If you do not wish to receive offers from these third parties, you may unsubscribe from their mailing lists by following the instructions in the offer. If you respond to any such offer, your information will be subject to that third party’s privacy policy. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders and to protect and defend the rights and interests of Egoras, its affiliates, suppliers, or users. In the event Egoras goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
                </p>
                <p>
                We may use and disclose your aggregated usage information with others, in a form that does not identify any individual, to allow Egoras and our advertisers to present targeted advertising to you. We may disclose to third parties, including advertisers and potential business partners, aggregated statistics that we develop from your usage habits, preferences, and history. For example, we may disclose generalized information about usage habits based on aggregated statistics developed from your site usage behaviour and search history. This statistical information will not identify any individual. Registering on Egoras or submission of personal information on any associate or partners channels enables you to receive communication regarding your transaction and any information considered of benefit to you that is sent out from time to time.
                </p>
                <p>
                We may use your personal information to send you periodic service communication through various forms including but not limited to SMS’s, emails, app notifications and any other means for which you have provided credentials in order to receive such communication directly to Egoras or through an affiliate, associate or partner of Egoras. You will be deemed to have “opted in” to receive such communication unless you request to “opt out” by sending an email toinfo@Egoras.in or by clicking the unsubscribe button on email communication sent to you.
